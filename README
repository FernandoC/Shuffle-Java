Compiling Instructions: Download all the files and type "make" in SSH

Files Submitted: List.java, ListTest.java, Shuffle.java, Makefile, and README

List.java:       Contains the doubly linked List ADT and all its functions.

ListTest.java:   Contains a program that uses the List ADT to make sure everything
                 is in order by calling all of its functions. 

Shuffle.java:    Reads in a file and creats a List of permutations. 
                 It then applies this permutation to a normal List. It does this
                 until the List is back to normal and prints out the order or 
                 amount of iterations it took to get back to normal. 

Makefile:        Compiles everything and makes the Shuffle program into a jar file.

README:          The title serves its purpose.
